Treat the thesis above as the user's primary portfolio mandate.
Kick off the first agentic session now and seed the portfolio using that thesis:
- propose initial strategy definitions aligned with the thesis and risk-aware position sizing;
- identify and propose initial positions that express the thesis;
- explain why each strategy and position maps to the thesis and what would invalidate it.
Operate as the first portfolio seeding workflow.
